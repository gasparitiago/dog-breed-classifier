# Dog breed classifier

This project is divided into two parts: The WebApp developed to classify dog breeds and the training process which was used to generate a machine learning model used by the web app.

## WebApp

The project can be used directly in this streamlit page: https://share.streamlit.io/gasparitiago/dog-breed-classifier/main/stream.py

If you want to deploy the webapp locally you can simply use streamlit:

```
    pip install streamlit
    streamlit run stream.py
```

## Project Overview

The project overview, including the motivation, approaches, methodology, results and conclusions can be found in this Medium post: https://medium.com/@gasparitiago/developing-a-dog-breed-classifier-e2348602cb99

If you want to re-train the model or take a look at how the project has been developed, or the motivations of it, you can take a look at the `dog_app.ipynb` file. This file was used to train the models and to analyze the data used in the Medium blog post and in the Web app.
